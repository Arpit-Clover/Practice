For Clover merchants in the US, Canada, and Argentina, signature verification is no longer required as a cardholder verification method (CVM). The verify or reject signature screen is replaced with a signature screen that does not require merchant action. CVM in receipts now displays “Signature” instead of “Signature Verified.”
